## Overview

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking spaces in an attempt to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O)
- Dynamic console interface with a clear screen between moves
- Input validation to ensure valid moves
- Detection of win and tie conditions
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lucasbrasantos/java-tic-tac-toe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3. Compile the Java file:
    ```sh
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```
4. Run the compiled Java program:
    ```sh
    java TicTacToe
    ```

## Gameplay

1. The game will display an example board with positions labeled 1-9.
2. Players take turns to input their move by entering the position number where they want to place their mark.
3. The game will clear the screen after each move and display the updated board.
4. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

## Project Structure

- `TicTacToe.java`: The main Java file containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts and skills were reinforced:

- Basic Java syntax and structure
- Control flow with loops and conditionals
- Array manipulation
- Input validation
- Console-based user interfaces
- Game logic implementation
